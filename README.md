# hpoon
Harpoon like functionality in the terminal

## Usage:
    hpoon [dir] [opt-name]  | store a mark, optionally with a name
    hpoon                   | retrieve the last marked file or dir
    hpoon @[name]           | retrieve marked file with name

Can only mark files and directories that exist, but can retrieve
marks that no longer exist on the filesystem. Names will be stripped
to be letters only; if stripping occurs, will print out the name

## Examples:

    cd /path/to/dir     # cd to a dir
    hpoon .             # harpoon it

    # in a different shell (ie: tmux)
    cd /new/abs/dir     # totally different dir
    cp * `hpoon`      # copy files over to the last harpooned dir

    # works on deleted files
    hpoon filename myfile           #harpoon a file with "myfile"
    rm filename
    cd /somewhere/else/entirely
    mv some_file `hpoon @myfile` # result: mv that_file /original/path/filename
`
